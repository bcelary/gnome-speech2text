# Whisper Typing GNOME Extension

A GNOME Shell extension that adds speech-to-text functionality using
[OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model. Speak into your microphone and have your words automatically typed out.

I wrote this extension to make it easier for me to use speech-to-text in my daily workflow, especially as I have become
a heavy user of Cursor AI and speech is much faster than typing. I'm on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and GNOME 46, and unfortunately
Ubuntu doesn't have a native speech-to-text feature yet. This is my first GNOME extension, hopefully it's as bug-free and
useful as it can be but if you're having difficulties please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and I'll do my best to help you out.

## Features
