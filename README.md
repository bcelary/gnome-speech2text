**Important for GNOME Extensions Store**: This extension follows GNOME's architectural guidelines by using a separate D-Bus service for speech processing. The extension itself is lightweight and communicates with the external service over D-Bus using the `org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.Speech2Text` interface. The service is **not bundled** with the extension and must be installed separately as a dependency. This extension requires the external background service [gnome-speech2text-service](https://pypi.org/project/gnome-speech2text-service/) to be installed. The first time you run the extension you will get a popup to guide you through this setup. 

## Architecture

The extension consists of two components:

1. **GNOME Extension** (lightweight UI) - Provides the panel button, keyboard shortcuts, and settings
2. **D-Bus Service** (separate package) - Handles audio recording, speech transcription, and text insertion

This separation ensures the extension follows GNOME's best practices and security guidelines.

## Features

- üé§ **Speech Recognition** using OpenAI Whisper
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Automatic Text Insertion** at cursor location (only on X11)
- üñ±Ô∏è **Click to Record** from top panel microphone icon
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcut** support (default: Alt+Super+R)
- üåç **Multi-language Support** (depending on Whisper model)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Configuration** through settings panel
- üîí **Privacy-First** - All processing happens locally
- üñ•Ô∏è **X11 and Wayland Support**

## Display Server Compatibility

### X11 (Full Support)

- ‚úÖ Text insertion works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Preview dialog with Insert/Copy options
- ‚úÖ Skip preview option for instant text insertion
- ‚úÖ Auto-skip preview option available for X11 sessions

### Wayland (Limited Support)

- ‚úÖ Speech recognition works perfectly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Text insertion has limitations due to Wayland security restrictions
- ‚úÖ Copy to clipboard always works

## Requirements

### System Dependencies

- GNOME Shell 46 or later (tested up to GNOME 48)
- Python 3.8 or later
- FFmpeg (for audio recording)
- xdotool (for text insertion on X11 only)
- Clipboard tool: xclip/xsel (X11) or wl-clipboard (Wayland)

### Installation of System Dependencies

Before installing the extension, make sure you have the required system packages installed on your distribution.

Important:

- The bundled installer `src/install-service.sh` is distro-agnostic. It only checks for required packages and will not install system packages for you.
- You should install the system packages using your distribution's package manager.
- We provide Ubuntu/Debian commands below as an example only.

#### Ubuntu/Debian (example)

```bash
# For X11 sessions
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg xdotool xclip python3-dbus python3-gi

# For Wayland sessions
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg wl-clipboard python3-dbus python3-gi
```

## Installation

### GNOME Extensions Store

**Installation from GNOME Extensions Store**

1. Visit [GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8238/gnome-speech2text/) and click "Install"
2. The extension will automatically detect required system packages and let you know what you will need to install
3. Follow the setup dialog to install the required D-Bus service (automatically downloads from PyPI)
4. Restart GNOME Shell to complete the installation

### Quick Installation

For the easiest installation experience on Ubuntu/Debian, use the repository installer script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text.git
cd gnome-speech2text
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian: Run the installation script

```
./install.sh
```

This script will (on Ubuntu/Debian):

- Check system dependencies and guide you through installing any missing ones
- Install the D-Bus service automatically (from local source or PyPI)
- Install the GNOME extension and compile schemas
- Apply compatibility fixes for GNOME 48/Wayland automatically
- Provide instructions for restarting GNOME Shell
-
#### Other linux distros

```
make install
```

This will install the extension, but you have to manually install the dependencies listed above for your linux distro. After installation the first-time you use the extension you will get a pop-up how to install the d-bus service.

### First Time Setup

The extension automatically detects if the required service is missing and provides a user-friendly setup dialog with automatic or manual installation options.

Notes about installers and distributions:

- The extension bundle includes `src/install-service.sh`, a distro-agnostic service installer that only verifies system dependencies and installs the Python D-Bus service into `~/.local/share/gnome-speech2text-service`.
- You must install system packages yourself using your distro‚Äôs package manager. The setup dialog will list any missing packages.
- The top-level `install.sh` script in this repository provides Ubuntu/Debian-specific guidance and commands as an example to help install required packages and set up the extension end-to-end.


### Alternative: Service-Only Installation

If you only want to install the D-Bus service (for development or advanced users):

```bash
# Install just the service from local source
./src/install-service.sh --local

# Or install from PyPI
./src/install-service.sh --pypi
```
The service is available as a Python package on PyPI: [gnome-speech2text-service](https://pypi.org/project/gnome-speech2text-service/)

#### IMPORTANT: Restart GNOME Shell After Installation

**For X11 sessions:**

1. Press `Alt+F2`
2. Type `r`
3. Press `Enter`

**For Wayland sessions:**

1. Log out of your current session
2. Log back in

#### Troubleshooting Installation

If the extension doesn't appear in GNOME Extensions:

```bash
# View extension logs
journalctl -f | grep -E "(gnome-shell|gnome-speech2text-service|speech2text|ffmpeg|org\.gnome\.Speech2Text)"

# Check installation status
make status

# Verify schema compilation
make verify-schema

```

If the D-Bus service isn't working:

```bash
# Check if service is running
dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.Speech2Text /org/gnome/Shell/Extensions/Speech2Text org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.Speech2Text.GetServiceStatus

# Start the service manually
~/.local/share/gnome-speech2text-service/gnome-speech2text-service

# Check D-Bus service file
ls ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.Speech2Text.service
```

You can read more about the D-Bus service here: [D-Bus Service Documentation](./service/README.md).

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Click** the microphone icon in the top panel, or
2. **Press** the keyboard shortcut (default: Alt+Super+R)
3. **Speak** when the recording dialog appears
4. **Review** the transcribed text in the preview dialog
5. **Click Insert** to type the text, or **Copy** to clipboard

### Settings

Right-click the microphone icon to access:

- **Settings**: Configure extension preferences
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Customize the recording hotkey
  - **Recording Duration**: Set maximum recording time (10-300 seconds)
  - **Copy to Clipboard**: Automatically copy transcribed text
  - **Skip Preview (X11 only)**: Instantly insert text without preview
- **Setup Guide**: View service installation instructions anytime

## Troubleshooting

### GNOME Shell Crashes (GNOME 48/Wayland)

If you experience GNOME Shell crashes when using the extension, use the crash analysis script:

```bash
# After a crash, run the debug script
./debug-crash.sh
```

This script will analyze system logs and generate a detailed crash report. Choose option 1 (last 30 minutes) after experiencing a crash. The script will create a timestamped file with all relevant crash information.

### Text Insertion Not Working

1. **On X11**: Ensure xdotool is installed
2. **On Wayland**: Text insertion is limited - use Copy to Clipboard instead
3. Check if target application accepts simulated keyboard input

## Uninstallation

### Gnome Extensions

You should be able to uninstall the extension directly using the GNOME Extensions tool.

### Manual Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove everything (extension + service)
make clean
```

## Privacy & Security

üîí **100% Local Processing** - All speech recognition happens on your local machine. Nothing is ever sent to the cloud or external servers. The extension uses OpenAI's Whisper model locally, ensuring privacy of your voice data.

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
# Complete development setup (install extension + service + compile schemas)
make setup

# Check installation status
make status

# Clean installation (extension + d-bus service)
make clean
```
