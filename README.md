# GNOME Speech2Text

A GNOME Shell extension that adds speech-to-text functionality using
[OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model. Speak into your microphone
and have your words automatically typed wherever your cursor is.

I wrote this extension to mostly use with Cursor AI since speaking is much faster than typing. I'm on Ubuntu 24.04 and
GNOME Shell 46, and unfortunately couldn't find any existing extensions that did this, so I built this over a weekend half
vibe-learning GNOME extensions and half vice-coding the actual script.

## Features

- üé§ **Real-time Speech Recognition** using OpenAI Whisper
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Automatic Text Insertion** at cursor location
- üñ±Ô∏è **Click to Record** from top panel microphone icon
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard Shortcut** support (default: Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C)
- üåç **Multi-language Support** (depending on Whisper model)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Configuration** through settings panel

**Note: This extension is currently only working on X11. If there's interest in Wayland support, I can look into it.**

## Requirements

- GNOME Shell 46 or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- FFmpeg
- xdotool

## System Requirements Installation

Before installing the extension, make sure you have the required system packages:

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg xdotool libglib2.0-dev
```

I have only tested this on Ubuntu 24.04, but it should work on any GNOME Shell 46+ distribution with the above packages installed.

## Installation

### Option 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

Run this single command to download and install everything automatically:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Then restart GNOME Shell:

- **X11**: Press Alt+F2, type 'r', press Enter
- **Wayland**: Log out and log back in

### Option 2: From Local Repository

If you prefer to clone the repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text.git
cd gnome-speech2text
./scripts/install.sh
```
